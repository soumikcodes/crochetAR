# Mixed Reality and Tangible Interactions - Project Report

## About the Project
This project aims to bridge the tactile world of handcrafted crochet art with the immersive realm of augmented reality (AR). By using crocheted patterns as AR markers, the application creates an innovative platform where the user can interact with an AR object spawned upon the crocheted artifact. 

It is both a creative exploration of technology and a celebration of traditional craft. For instance, a crocheted butterfly pattern generates a lifelike virtual butterfly that moves within the AR space and can be interacted with. Also, the butterfly changes color when specific targets are observed.
